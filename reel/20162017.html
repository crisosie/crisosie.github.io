		<h2> Maya - Illuminate and add textures.</h2>
	
		<p> Add lights, materials and textures to create a photo-realistic render of a scene
			downloaded from 3drender.com. The modelling software used was Maya and the rendering
			software MentalRay.</p>
			
		<p> As an engineer I am  interested on how artists use their tools and the possible
			problems they may face. I took the Advanced Animation and Modelling course at De 
			Montfort University to actually experience what artists have to face everyday. I 
			am not aiming to get a lighting/texturing job but to experience their working 
			routine to be better prepared as a Technical Director.</p>
		
		
		<h2> Blender - Trail geometry add-on.</h2>
		
		<p> Python add-on programmed for the 3D modelling software Blender. The add-on generates 
			a trail of spheres both static and dynamic. </p>
		
		<p>The add-on has five different parts: path generation, geometry generation (both static 
			and dynamic), delete geometry, select geometry and change material of the trail. </p>
		
		<p>Path generation uses arrow empties with a name and time attribute. It gets the x-axis 
			direction of two arrow empties and interpolates a path using Hermite. It has a tension 
			parameter that allows sharper/smoother turns. </p> 
		
		<p>Geometry can be generated in two ways: static and dynamic. The static will remain 
			static when rendered while the dynamic will move along the path simulating a trail. 
			Static and dynamic generation both share several parameters: we can set the geometry to 
			get smaller as objects are generated; control the number of spheres generated; and decide 
			the distance between the first and the last sphere.
			Dynamic trails add automatically keyframes for rendering. We can also decide if the 
			geometry will remain visible to the render at the last key frame. </p>
		
		<p> The final renders show some basic examples using the Blender add-on.</p>
