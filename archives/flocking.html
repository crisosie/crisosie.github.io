	<h1>Flocking</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Flocking is a natural behaviour found in some birds, fish and
			flying insects that occurs when they group together while 
			moving. Though each species has different characteristics in 
			the movement they all show similarities. The most obvious similarity
			is the way these animals move locally without hitting each other 
			while moving globally in unison as one group. Some species such as the 
			starling is known to form groups of up to a million or more.  
		</p>
		<p>In this project I implemented two different algorithmic approaches
			developed in an attempt to recreate the natural phenomenon. The 
			first approach called boids was developed by Craig W. Reynolds and
			divides the motion in a series of behaviours that when added all together 
			result in the desired flocking behaviour. The second algorithm called
			PSO was developed by  R.Eberhart y J. Kennedy and is an algorithm that
			was quickly extrapolated to optimization exercises. It works searching
			for the best optimal distance from each other at every iteration.
		</p>
		<p>The video shows four different scenarios: a basic boid implementation, 
			boid with obstacle collision, prey-predator boid, and finally PSO with 
			obstacle collision.
