	<h1>Physically Based Rendering</h1>
	<div>
		<p>In this project we investigate a series of algorithms and 
			effects used to render 3D virtual images. The two effects
			implemented are depth of field and envronment mapping
		</p>

		<h2>Depth of field</h2>
		<p>Depth of field is an effect that replicates a light artifact
			that happens due to the use of lenses. We can change the point 
			of focus on the image and blur out specific points on the images
			depending on their depth from the camera.

		</div>

		<h2>Environment Mapping</h2>
		<p>Environment Mapping assumes that a light source at an infinite 
			distance illuminates a scene. By changing this light source the 
			image changes drastically on its mood and colour.

		</div>

		<h2>Final Project - Ovni Fun!</h2>
		<p>For our final project we used both depth of field and environment mapping
			on a scene we've called "Ovni Fun!" that tries to replicate the abduction
			of some cow toys from a kids point of view.
