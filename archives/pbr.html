	<h1>Physically Based Rendering</h1>
	<div>
		<p>In this project we investigate a series of algorithms and 
			effects used to render 3D virtual images. The two effects
			implemented are depth of field and envronment mapping.
		</p>

		<h2>Final Project - Ovni Fun!</h2>
		<p>For our final project we implemented a basic raytracer with two
			visual effects: depth of field and environment mapping. The scene
			we've creates is called "Ovni Fun!" and shows a scene of a kid playing with
			their toys and kitchenware.

		</div>

		<h2>Depth of field</h2>
		<p>Depth of field happens in lenses and is an effect that causes a light 
			capture artifact. We can change the point of focus on the image and 
			blur out specific points on the images depending on their distance 
			from the camera.

		<h2>Environment Mapping</h2>
		<p>Environment Mapping assumes that an HDI image is the source of a light 
			place at the infinite. The image engulfs the scene and contributes
			globally to the illumination of the scene. By changing the image source the 
			render's mood and colour changes drastically.
