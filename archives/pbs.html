	<h1>Physically Based Simulation</h1>
	<div>
		<p>Physically based simulation shows algorithmic implementations
			of physically realistic simulations. The works shown here are 
			mainly based on the PBD algorithm used to solve Navier Stokes'
			equations.
		</p>
		<h2>Cloth simulation</h2>
		<p>
			Cloth is simulated using the mass-spring model. Different 
			integrators are implemented to explore the effect they have
			on the final result.
