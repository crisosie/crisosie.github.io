			<h2> What is its use? </h2>
			<p> The tool creates, through a very simple-to-use interface, all necessary 
				Maya Nodes needed to simulate the creation of dust on collision between 
				two geometries.</p>
			
			<h2> Why implement it? </h2>    
			<p> In September 2017 I started working at Barreira's animation studio. The 
				animation short being developed had a sci-fi Western style. Western are 
				known for their desert and dusty environments. It was the first time the 
				studio worked on a short set completely outside. A better realistic feel 
				would be accomplished visually, if the characters were to bring up dust 
				every time they walked around. Manually setting-up a fluid emissor for 
				every contact would be a colossal task for any FX artist. That's why I was 
				given the task of generating a system that would automatically create dust 
				on every contact. </p>
			
			<h2> How to use it? </h2>  
			<p> The IU is divided into two frames: the creation section and the manipulation 
				section. </p>

			<p>The creation section creates our system. We need three parameters for the 
				creation of the system: the group name, the surface name and the animated 
				geometry name. In order to have a tidy scene, when we create the system, 
				all nodes needed will be parented to a Group Object. This group will be 
				created using the name provided during the creation of the system. This 
				is the first parameter that we need to fill in. The surface name is the 
				name of the object that will be emitting the fluid on contact. It can have 
				any shape but there can only be one per system. The user can middle drag the 
				name of the surface from the Outliner to the corresponding textfield. Finally, 
				the animated geometry name corresponds to all those geometries that we want 
				to react with the surface. Geometries can be selected from the Outliner and 
				middle-dragged onto the corresponding textfield. When dragging multiple objects 
				these will be separated at the textfield by ", " (commaspace). If typing in 
				the names, this ", " must also be included between different objects. </p>
			
			<p>The manipulation section allows us to dynamically alter attributes from every 
				Maya Object used by the system. Currently only the emission rate has been 
				implemented. We can keyframe this rate to control whether the fluid must be
				emitted on collision or not.</p>

			<h2>Implementation design </h2>
			<p> The tool was initially programmed using MEL but was finally translated to 
				Python. For the tool to work we need to make Maya to be able to respond to 
				procedural calculations. This was accomplished by using SOuP nodes that one 
				can purchase<a href="http://www.soup-dev.com/"> here.</a> The tool won't work 
				if the nodes are not present or if the nodes haven't been loaded into Maya. </p>
			
			<p>The tool is divided into two different python files. The first file is the Dust 
				Class file. When we initialize this object we give it a flag value that 
				determines whether the file already exists or if it's a new object. If it's a 
				new object it will create all necessary Maya nodes and set correctly all node 
				connections. If not it will simply initialize the obect with the correct 
				parameters. </p>
		
			<p> The second file is the DustController file. This file controls all UI aspects 
				and function aspects. It creates the UI we want and assigns all UI commands to 
				an internal function controller. This controller detects the command called and 
				determines the correct function to be executed. With the final user in mind we 
				process all data introduced into the textfields to make them look manageable to 
				the user. Each textfield has its own processing: surface name only allows one 
				name, animated geometries allows several objects introduced and the group name 
				from manipulation section allows only one father DAG object. </p>
		
			<p> When we press the "Create" Button what we are really doing is creating objects 
				of the class Dust. We add these objects to a dustObjectList. When using the 
				manipulation section we use the objects stored in this dustObjectList. In case 
				we have closed the UI window (and therefore lost the object list), this process 
				also checks the scene looking for a group object with all the dust attributes. 
				If it finds one it will create a new dust object (only initializing its parameter) 
				with these parameters and add the object to the objectList for simpler use. </p>
		
			<p> Before creating the dust object we check that all the data introduced is the desired 
				data. If it is not we have a series of errors that will explain to the user the reason 
				it is not working. By checking the data before creating the object we avoid having to go 
				back on our traces and delete any Maya Objects we may have created on the way. </p>
