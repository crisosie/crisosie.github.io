		<div class="about">
			<p>My name is Cristian Soler Sierra and I am a Spanish Multimedia engineer 
				highly interested in creating tools for animation and videogame artists. 
				I finished my Master's Degree on Computer Graphics at Universidad Rey Juan 
				Carlos of Madrid (2019-2020). I studied Multimedia Engineering at Universidad de
				Valencia(2013-2018) and benefitted from an Erasmus Program with De Montfort Univeristy
				at Leicester, UK (2016-2017). 
			</p>

			<p>I've been working as a Lighting TD at Skydance Animation Madrid since April 2020 for 
				three of their projects: <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt14460998/">Blush</a>, 
				<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7214954/">Luck</a> and 
				<a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt7215232/">Spellbound</a>. For the first year at 
				Skydance I was in charge of fixing general bugs for all departments. Currently my work 
				is focused on the Shading, Lighting and Compo Departments where I polish their publishers, 
				importers and main tools usually working on improving their UIs to make them more intuitive 
				to use.</p>

			<p>In 2017 I worked as a Technical Director for Barreira Arte y Dise√±o, SL. 
				an educational centre that develops every year an animation short film. Later on
				I worked for Bikes AIE on the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9422468/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt">"Bikes, The Movie"</a>.
				I therefore have experience developing simple and intuitive tools with 
				MEL, Python and PyQt.</p>

			<p>I am a very creative person with many artistic interests such as photography, 
				classical music and origami. I studied classical music for 15 years and 
				dedicated 11 years learning how to play the violin. I finally graduated from 
				Quart de Poblet's Mestre Molins conservatory in 2015.</p>

			<p>I love learning new languages: I am fluent in Spanish, English, French and Catalonian
				and I have basic notions of both German and Mandarin.</p>

			<p>I have worked with C, C++, Java, HTML5 and JavaScript, CSS3, Python, PySide2 and MEL. 
				I have recently studied CUDA programming, modern OpenGL programming and 
				implemented advanced rendering and simulation algorithms.</p>

			<p>I hope you enjoy my portfolio which includes many of my university courseworks 
				I did at Universidad de Valencia, at De Montfort University and finally at Universidad Rey
				Juan Carlos. </p>
