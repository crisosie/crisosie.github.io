	<h1>About me</h1>
	<div>
		<div class="about">
			<p>My name is Cristian Soler Sierra and I am a Spanish Multimedia engineer 
				highly interested in creating tools for animation and videogame artists. 
				I am currently finishing my Master's Degree on Computer Graphics at Universidad
				Rey Juan Carlos of Madrid. </p>

			<p>In 2017 I worked as a Technical Director for Barreira Arte y Dise√±o, SL. 
				an educational centre that develops every year an animation short film. Later on
				I worked for Bikes AIE on the movie <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt9422468/?ref_=ttfc_fc_tt">"Bikes, The Movie"</a>.
				I therefore have quite some experience developing simple and intuitive tools with 
				MEL, Python and PyQt.</p>

			<p>I am a very creative person with many artistic interests such as photography, 
				classical music and origami. I studied violin for 11 years and graduated from 
				Quart de Poblet's Mestre Molins conservatory.</p>

			<p>I love learning new languages: I am fluent in Spanish, English, French and Valencian
				and I have basic notions of both German and Mandarin.</p>

			<p>I have worked with C, C++, Java, html5 and javascript, css, Python and MEL. 
				I have recently studied CUDA programming, modern OpenGL programming and 
				implemented advanced rendering and simulation algorithms. </p>

			<p>I hope you enjoy my portfolio which includes many of my university courseworks 
				I did both at Universidad de Valencia, de Montfort University and Universidad Rey
				Juan Carlos. </p>
