	<h1>About me!</h1>
	<p>My name is Cristian Soler Sierra and I am a Spanish Multimedia engineer 
		highly interested in creating tools for animation and videogame artists. 
		I am currently finishing my Master's Degree on Computer Graphics from the 
		URJC at Madrid.</p>

	<p>In 2017 I started working as a Technical Director for Barreira Arte y Diseño, SL. 
		an educational centre that develops every year an animation short film. Later on
		I started working for Bikes AIE on the movie <a href="/about">"Bikes, The Movie"</a>
		I therefore have quite some experience developing simple and intuitive tools with 
		MEL, Python and PyQt.</p>

	<p>I am a very creative person with many artistic interests such as photography, 
		classical music and origami. I studied violin for 11 years and graduated from 
		the Ciclo de Enseñanza Profesional - Especialidad Violín (Professional Music 
		Studies - Violin Specialty) at Quart de Poblet's Mestre Molins conservatory.</p>

	<p>I love learning new languages, from which I am fluent to different levels in 
		4 (Spanish, English, Valencian and French) and have basic notions of 2 others 
		(German and Mandarin).</p>

	<p>I have worked with C, C++, Java, html5 and javascript, css, Python and MEL. 
		I have recently studied CUDA programming, modern OpenGL programming and 
		implemented advanced rendering and simulation algorithms. </p>

	<p>I hope you enjoy my portfolio which includes many of my university courseworks 
		I did both at Universidad de Valencia, de Montfort University and Universidad Rey
		Juan Carlos. </p>
